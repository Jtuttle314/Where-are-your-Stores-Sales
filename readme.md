### Proposal: 
Goal: A geographic representation of servicing population by store location.  

The objective is to create a visual representation of store location and its patron population for distribution analysis.  

The challenge is acquiring accurate/ current population data for free and comparing with store front location, volume cluster & other publicly accessible variables and layering our findings in Plotly in a meaningful way.
